                <h2>Challenge</h2>
                <p> Using Debugging strategies, go back to previous labs that may have not worked as intended and fix them.
                </p>

                <h2>Problems</h2>
                <p> Throughout each lab we edited, we ran into several issues that were related to each lab. It took a while to remember how
                    we did each lab and how to change it based on the new requirements. Some more specific examples include: adding the defer statements and
                    links to jquery as well as changing function and variable names.
                </p>
            </div>
            <div class="minor-section">
                <h2>Reflection</h2>
                <p> We never really had a lab that didn't really work so we just tried to improve upon previous labs. After learning jQuery, there's a lot of
                    potential for changes to make. It's a nice opportunity to touch up on these labs given how much we have learned over the course of the class.

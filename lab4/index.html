			<h1>Lab 4 - Pseudocoding and Problem-solving</h1>
			<div class="minor-section">
					<h2>Challenge</h2>
					<p>Choose a simple computer game and create pseudocode for it. Create a javascript file that has the pseudocode commented in.</p>
			</div>

			<div class="minor-section">
					<h2>Problems</h2>
					<p>We had a bit of trouble trying to figure out a day to day activity that people would need instructions for, as most such tasks 
						are common sense. However, when we though about the lives of Santa Cruz students in particular, we realized we had a great
						resource available to us, an abundance of hiking trails! We weere able to make some code guiding others how to prepare and engage in
						a hike, which could potentially be a dangerous endeavor. Other than that issue, we did not have any problems!</p>
			</div>

			<div class="minor-section">
					<h2>Reflection</h2>
					<p>Put your reflections about this assignment here. How did it go? What kind of energy did you put into the assignment? 

						We were able to complete the pseudo codes rather quickly and easily, is what we thought after we finished the first draft.
						After coming back and reexamining our work however, we discovered that we had either rushed through or ignored entirely necessary 
						steps for the game to function. for example, We had created all the instructions for the game to function before we realized we had included
                        nothing that would actually allow the players to see the state of the game! If we did player, they effectively would have been forced to
						play in the dark. After some revisions however, we now feel confident that our pseudocode is sufficient and the assignment went smoothly.
						Putting a heightened amount of energy into this assignment was unnecessary once we had everything figured out, but it was still a learning
                        experience in the practice of pseudo coding.

					<pre><code>
						<h3>Going Hiking Pseudocode</h3>
			
			- Hiking Task List
				- Preparation Steps
					- Decide on where you want to go! Research hiking trails in the area, and select one that you think you would like!
						- Keep in mind the difficulty of the trek, or scenery you would like to visit!
						- Check the weather forecast! You don’t want to be surprised by rain on your day out!
						- Make sure you pack sources of water and food, hiking takes a lot of energy.
						- Bring safety equipment such as first aid in case you get hurt! Nature can be beautiful, but it is also dangerous.
				- Activity Steps
					- Arrive on the scene. Take a deep breath, your adventure is about to begin!
					- Be aware of your surroundings, whether it be dangerous animals or treacherous conditions.
					- Make sure you are hydrated, dehydration is very dangerous especially in the wilderness.
					- If you are new to hiking, take it slow! The ground can be less stable than expected, and getting a twisted ankle in the wilderness can be inconvenient.
					- Know your limits. You may feel invigorated on your trip, but you don’t want to use up all your energy before you make the trek back. 
						When in doubt, don’t be afraid to turn around! The trail will still be there another day.
					- Have fun! Immersing yourself in nature can be very refreshing from your day-to-day life, make sure you make the most of it!

			     <pre><code> <h3>Go Fish Pseudocode</h3>
					// 1: Create a deck (an array of 52 items) of playing cards, 4 of each card type, and shuffle them randomly.
					// 2: Ask how many players will play the game, awaiting a numerical input from 2 to 6.
					   	//2.1: If an invalid input is given, display an error and repeat the prompts.
					// 3: Create a match variable for each person, representing each player's "points" twoards victory. Initialize each at 0.
					// 4: Give each player 7 cards from the deck into their hand, removing them from the top of the deck array and inserting them into the different “hand” arrays.
					// 5: Randomly order a list of player names to represent player order.
					// Begin game loop
					  	// 6: Display each player’s current hand on their screen.
					  	// 7: Begin the next player’s turn.
							// 7.1: If a player has no cards, draw a card from the deck and skip to step 10.
					  	/ 8: Have player select another player
					  	// 9: Have player select a card type (Kings, Queens, Jacks, etc.) that they contain in their hand.
							// 9.1:  if that player has 1 or more cards of that card type:
							  	// 9.1.1: remove all cards of that type from selected player’s hand
							  	// 9.1.2: If the player now has 4 of the same card type, remove those cards from their hand and add 1 to that person’s match.
						  	// 9.2: if else
								// 9.2.1: the player who asked draws 1 card from the deck
					  	// 10: Display to all players who asked a card from whom (if any), how many cards were taken (if any), and who drew a card from the deck (if any).
					  	// 11: Move the current player to the end of the turn order.
					  	// 12: If there still exists some cards in the deck or any player’s hands, return to step 6. Else, break from loop.
				  	// 13: Else, Whichever player has the most match points here is the winner, and the game terminates.

					<h2>About Me</h2>
						<p>My name is Joey, but I also go by a few online names such as WePurpyPoo or We32. I'm a 3rd year AGPM major at UCSC but my favorite class I've taken is actually Writing 1 & 2. I was born in Las Vegas and moved to
						the Bay Area when I was 4 years old; living there ever since. I got a Nintendo DS with New Super Mario Bros. and Pokemon Platinum and I've played
						a variety of video games ever since. I started making Youtube Videos when I was 12 and have continued that to this current day. All along the way
						I've continued to hone my editing skills to create content that I'm proud of. I have also done a good amount of digital art for the past few years,
						in which I have continued to improve as well. The persona I use for everything is my favorite pokemon, Braixen. It's my profile picture on basically
						every account, it's what I've drawn the most of, and it's also right on this web page.

						<p>Thoughout my time at UCSC, I've realized that I like to explore topics of social justice. I have created projects relating to mental health, my own racial identity, and LGBTQ+ issues.
						I like speaking up about these topics because I'm getting my own story out there. These stories can then have the extra effect of resonating with other people who have had similar experiences.
						Although I still don't have a particular career in mind for myself, I would love to create stories, projects, or any sort of media that people can connect with. I want to share what I might have
						wanted to hear or see when I was struggling with many of the problems I've had through life. My goals are quite amibitious but I know that through this class and many more, I'll be a few steps closer to achieving said goals.	 </p>

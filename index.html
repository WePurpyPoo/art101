					<h2>About Me</h2>
					<p>My name is Joey, but I also go by a few online names such as WePurpyPoo or We32. I was born in Las Vegas and moved to
					the Bay Area when I was 4 years old; living there ever since. I got a Nintendo DS with New Super Mario Bros. and Pokemon Platinum and I've played
					a variety of video games ever since. I started making Youtube Videos when I was 12 and have continued that to this current day.

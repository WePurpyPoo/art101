                <h2>Challenge</h2>
                <p>Create an input box in an html document with a button that will take the input and turn it into a variable. Modify the input with the sort
                    name function from several labs ago and print it on the screen.
                </p>

            <div class="minor-section">
                <h2>Problems</h2>
                <p> We did have some issues with the button's functionality at first. After some minor confucion with the exact
                    placment of the onClick() function, we realized we made an error in one of the earlier functions. Instead of 
                    using text.length, we used text.length() in an attempt to get the length of a string, not realizing it was not meant to
                    be used like a function as it is in other programming languages.
                </p>
            </div>
            <div class="minor-section">
                <h2>Reflection</h2>
                <p> This was another great experience for us in using buttons with jQuery. As we normally do, we ran into some issues while trying to make the button work. 
                    We did learn a lot from that experience, spotting errors and looking back at old assignments for assistance.

                <h2>Challenge</h2>
                <p> Create in input box that asks for the user's name. Then create a javascript function that will assign a Hogwarts house
                    to the user depending on the length of their name.

                <h2>Problems</h2>
                <p> Most of the problems we had throughout this lab were not really problems that lasted long. Most of the time we were able to
                    figure out how to continue, especially with the help provided in the lectures and the assignment page. Some of these include
                    the button not working with the javascript, and having the text replace itself instead of adding onto the output constantly
                </p>
            </div>
            <div class="minor-section">
                <h2>Reflection</h2>
                <p> This lab was very nice and easy to understand especially given the lectures that gave us a lot of the info we needed to complete
                    the assignment. We also knew conditionals based on our prior knowledge of programming.

			<h1>Lab 3 - File Structure and File Transfer</h1>
			<div class="minor-section">
					<h2>Challenge</h2>
					<p>The challenge for the lab is to create a file structure that is neat and organized. We also need to create a homepage with
					the links to our labs on it and some information about ourselves.
					</p>
			</div>

			<div class="minor-section">
					<h2>Problems</h2>
					<p>Problems mostly arose when I was trying to create the CSS for my homepage. I wanted to make sure I was happy with how my website looked
					so I tried to implement some formatting that I didn't necessarily know how to do. Specificially, I didn't know how to have an image and text side by side.
					Luckily, W3schools saved the day again and so the CSS I used was taken from there. </p>
			</div>

			<div class="minor-section">
					<h2>Reflection</h2>
					<p> This assignment was nice to help flesh out my homepage because it was just a mess before this. I had just been messing with it, adding features as
						we would go through new things in lecture. I felt the same way I would when creating a piece of art with a sense of satisfaction at the end. </p>
			</div>

			<div class="minor-section">
					<h2>Results</h2>
					<p>My file structure is shown in the image below and my index.html will also be linked</p>
					<a href="art101\index.html">Index.html</a>

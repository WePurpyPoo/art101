                <p>Create a function that asks for the users name, then prints it's characters sorted.</p>

                <h2>Problems</h2>
                <p>When we first tested the code, it didn't actually print the sorted name. Turns out there was just no print line for the sorted name.
                    We also had issues with formatting the output of the script. It turns out that editing the "script" class directly had no effect on
                    it's output, and we instead needed to surround it with another class.
                </p>

                <h2>Reflection</h2>
                <p>Although the "fixed" version of these names may not really have any practical purposes, it is an excellent example of what may
                    be achieved with functions. We're exited to learn more technical feats we can achieve with them.

                <h2>Challenge</h2>
                <p> Using Debugging strategies, go back to previous labs that may have not worked as intended and fix them.
                </p>
            </div>
            <div class="minor-section">
                <h2>Problems</h2>
                <p> Throughout each lab we edited, we ran into several issues that were related to each lab. It took a while to remember how
                    we did each lab and how to change it based on the new requirements. Some more specific examples include: adding the defer statements and
                    links to jquery as well as changing function and variable names.
                </p>
            </div>
            <div class="minor-section">
                <h2>Reflection</h2>
                <p> We never really had a lab that didn't really work so we just tried to improve upon previous labs. After learning jQuery, there's a lot of
                    potential for changes to make. It's a nice opportunity to touch up on these labs given how much we have learned over the course of the class.
                </p>

                <h2>Debugging</h2>
                    <h2>Lab 6</h2>
                    <p>There was nothing particularly wrong with this lab, but knowing now how to manipulate DOMs, we wanted to retry it using jQuery.
                        Another reason we chose this one was because the script output had a 0 in it that really should not have been there. Now the text 
                        in the script output is affected by CSS 
                    </p>

                    <h2>Lab 7</h2>
                    <p>This lab was also fine as it was, but there was a couple things that we wanted to add to this one. Now that we knew how to use the input 
                        box, we used that instead of using the prompt command. Along with that, we added a button, but that main addition was the anagram function with 
                        the name tag. Similar to the example showed in class, we took an anagram function and used jQueries .html() to add it to the name tag.

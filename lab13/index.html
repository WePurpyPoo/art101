                <h2>Challenge</h2>
                <p> Create a Fizz!Bang!Boom! function that loops from 1 to 200 and prints the number along with either Fizz! Bang! or Boom! 
                    depending if the number is a multiple of 3, 5, or 7. If it is a mulitple of 2 or all of the numbers then it will combine the words.

                <h2>Problems</h2>
                <p> Creating the FizzBuzz function proposed somewhat of a challenge. At first it was hardcoded, but we decided that it would be better practice
                    not to hard code it. We had a version of the function that combined some of the numbers together, but we quickly realized that we put the br tag
                    in the wrong spot. 
                </p>

                <h2>Reflection</h2>
                <p> This lab proposed more of a challenge compared to other labs, especially it was during thanksgiving weekend. Though we were able to work through it
                    and get it done relatively quickly. We also decided to do some extra tasks, such as making an input for the max loop size, and creating columns so 
                    it would look nicer.

			<h1>Lab 6 - Arrays and Objects</h1>
			<div class="minor-section">
					<h2>Challenge</h2>
					<p>Create an array (myTransport) and an object (myMainRide). Then make a javascript program that outputs a sentence using the items in the array and object.</p>
			</div>

			<div class="minor-section">
					<h2>Problems</h2>
					<p>We had some mishaps with trying to properly format the objects for printing. While myTransport was easy enough to plug
					   into a print statment, it took a few tries to figure out how to properly format the stats of myMainRide in the console.
					   Such as missing a comma or the like. But with some good-old trial and error we figured it out lickedy-split! We also
					   had problems getting the script output to show up on the website, which we asked the TA about. It turns out that we can't
					   reference the object while defining it, so for the year function, we had to use this.year.</p>
			</div>

			<div class="minor-section">
					<h2>Reflection</h2>
					<p>This assignment went relatively smoothly as did the last one. Due to our existing knowledge in coding, we were able to swiftly create the arrays and objects.
						There isn't much else to talk about here.  </p>
			</div>

			<div class="minor-section">
					<h2>Results</h2>
					<p>Below is the output of our javascript file.</p>

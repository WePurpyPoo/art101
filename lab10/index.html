                <p>Create a javascipt file that will generate some fake dialogue using event listeners and a button.</p>

                <h2>Problems</h2>
                <p> We did have some issues with the button's functionality at first. After some minor confucion with the exact
                    placment of the onClick() function, we realized we made an error in one of the earlier functions. Instead of 
                    using text.length, we used text.length() in an attempt to get the length of a string, not realizing it was not meant to
                    be used like a function as it is in other programming languages.
                </p>
            </div>
            <div class="minor-section">
                <h2>Reflection</h2>
                <p> This was another great experience for us in using buttons with jQuery. As we normally do, we ran into some issues while trying to make the button work. 
                    We did learn a lot from that experience, spotting errors and looking back at old assignments for assistance.
